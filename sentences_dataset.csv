"The elopement of Lydia and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs.",english
"All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.",english
"Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the same unostentatious, but masterly fashion.",english
Also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty.,english
"Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool.",english
But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr.,english
And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one.,english
"She may even have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr.",english
"Bennet, she took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at work her fools and her mean persons.",english
"If her world is a microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness.",english
"Even Scott required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and German to enable them to chip the classical shell.",english
"The one was humanity, and the other was art.",english
"de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression.",english
"You get none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can shape a real impression out of the rest.",english
"But with Miss Austen the myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.",english
"Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself.",english
It has been said that no one ever was like him.,english
Collins was impossible or non-existent at the end of the eighteenth century.,english
"The formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural.",english
Collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of Mr.,english
"There is, perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me very faint indeed.",english
"It is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife, or when putting Mr.",english
"Bennet we have glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true.",english
Elizabeth of course belongs to the_ allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus.,english
There were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not.,english
"Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara Grant.",english
"I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I should, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana and Barbara.",english
A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.,english
"I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.",english
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.,english
"Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers.",english
"Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?",english
"She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.",english
The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.,english
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.,english
"Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.",english
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.,english
"But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.",english
"If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.",english
But I knew I should persuade you at last.,english
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.,english
"Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",english
"Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr.",english
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.,english
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had Mrs.,english
"Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.",english
"Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.",english
Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.,english
"And when the party entered the assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr.",english
"Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.",english
"Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.",english
"His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.",english
"Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.",english
"The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr.",english
"He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.",english
"Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.",english
"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.",english
Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr.,english
"Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it.",english
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.,english
"You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.",english
"At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.",english
"But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.",english
Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.,english
"She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.",english
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.,english
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.,english
"Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.",english
"Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.",english
"They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.",english
"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.",english
"Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.",english
"So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.",english
I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.,english
"So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring him!",english
"He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!",english
"I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.",english
"Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.",english
"Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.",english
What could be more natural than his asking you again?,english
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.,english
"Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.",english
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.,english
"With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!",english
Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere.,english
"Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.",english
"Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at Netherfield House.",english
"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.",english
Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was clever.,english
"He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.",english
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.,english
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.,english
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.,english
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much.,english
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.,english
"For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.",english
"By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.",english
"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.",english
"Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?",english
"If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs.",english
"One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself.",english
"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.",english
"There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.",english
"In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels.",english
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.,english
"As yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.",english
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.,english
"He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.",english
"Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.",english
"Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.",english
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.,english
"The insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people!",english
"Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.",english
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.,english
"Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.",english
"Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.",english
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.,english
"After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.",english
"Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.",english
"When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.",english
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this.,english
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.,english
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.,english
"Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.",english
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.,english
"Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.",english
"Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.",english
My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better.,english
"As long as she stays there, it is all very well.",english
"The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.",english
"Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.",english
"She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.",english
"That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.",english
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.,english
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.,english
"Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.",english
"The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.",english
"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.",english
"To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr.",english
"Bingley, she could not make a very favourable answer.",english
"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.",english
She had very little notice from any but him.,english
"Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.",english
"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.",english
"Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.",english
"Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?",english
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.,english
